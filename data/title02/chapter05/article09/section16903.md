# Section 16903

- (a) 

  - A partnership that desires to convert to a domestic or foreign other business entity shall approve a plan of conversion. The plan of conversion shall state the following:

  - (1) The terms and conditions of the conversion.

  - (2) The place of the organization of the converted entity and of the converting partnership and the name of the converted entity after conversion, if different from that of the converting partnership.

  - (3) The manner of converting the partnership interests of each of the partners into shares of, securities of, or interests in the converted entity.

  - (4) The provisions of the governing documents for the converted entity, including the limited partnership agreement, limited liability company articles of organization and operating agreement, or articles or certificate of incorporation if the converted entity is a corporation, to which the holders of interest in the converted entity are to be bound.

  - (5) Any other details or provisions as are required by laws under which the converted entity is organized.

  - (6) Any other details or provisions that are desired.

- (b) The plan of conversion shall be approved by that number or percentage of partners required by the partnership agreement to approve a conversion of the partnership as set forth in the partnership agreement. If the partnership agreement fails to specify the required partner approval for a conversion of the partnership, the plan of conversion shall be approved by that number or percentage of partners required by the partnership agreement to approve an amendment to the partnership agreement unless the conversion effects a change for which the partnership agreement requires a greater number or percentage of partners than that required to amend the partnership agreement, in which case the plan of conversion shall be approved by that greater number or percentage. If the partnership agreement fails to specify the vote required to amend the partnership agreement, the plan of conversion shall be approved by all partners.

- (c) If the partnership is converting into a limited partnership, in addition to the approval of the partners as set forth in subdivision (b), the plan of conversion shall be approved by all partners who will become general partners of the converted limited partnership pursuant to the plan of conversion.

- (d) All partners of the converting partnership except those that dissociate upon effectiveness of the conversion pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 16909 shall be deemed parties to any partnership or operating agreement, articles or certificate of incorporation, or organic document for the converted entity adopted as part of the plan of conversion, regardless of whether that partner has executed the plan of conversion or the operating agreement, articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, or other organic document for the converted entity. Any adoption of a new partnership or operating agreement, articles or certificate of incorporation, or other organic document made pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be effective at the effective time or date of the conversion.

- (e) Notwithstanding its prior approval, a plan of conversion may be amended before the conversion takes effect if the amendment is approved by the partnership in the same manner, and by the same number or percentage of partners, as was required for approval of the original plan of conversion.

- (f) The partners of a converting partnership may, at any time before the conversion is effective, in their discretion, abandon a conversion, without further approval by the partners, in the same manner, and by the same number or percentage of partners, as was required for approval of the original plan of conversion at any time before the conversion is effective, subject to the contractual rights of third parties.

- (g) 

  - The converted entity shall keep the plan of conversion at:

  - (1) the principal place of business of the converted entity, if the converted entity is a foreign other business entity or a corporation; or

  - (2) the office at which records are to be kept under Section 15614 or 15901.14 if the converted entity is a domestic limited partnership, or at the office at which records are to be kept under Section 17701.13 if the converted entity is a domestic limited liability company.

  - Upon the request of a partner of a converting partnership, the authorized person on behalf of the converted entity shall promptly deliver to the partner or the holder of interests or other securities, at the expense of the converted entity, a copy of the plan of conversion. A waiver by a partner of the rights provided in this subdivision shall be unenforceable.

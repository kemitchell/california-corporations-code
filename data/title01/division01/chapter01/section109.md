# Section 109

- (a) Any agreement, certificate or other instrument relating to a domestic or foreign corporation filed pursuant to this division may be corrected with respect to any misstatement of fact contained therein, any defect in the execution thereof or any other error or defect contained therein, by filing a certificate of correction entitled “Certificate of Correction of ____ (insert here the title of the agreement, certificate or other instrument to be corrected and name(s) of corporation or corporations)”; provided, however, that no such certificate of correction shall alter the wording of any resolution or written consent which was in fact adopted by the board or the shareholders or effect a corrected amendment of articles which amendment as so corrected would not in all respects have complied with the requirements of this division at the time of filing of the agreement, certificate, or other instrument being corrected.

- (b) If the certificate of correction corrects original articles, the certificate of correction shall be either an officers’ certificate or a certificate signed and verified by the incorporators, or a majority of them. If the certificate of correction corrects an agreement of merger or an officers’ certificate accompanying an agreement of merger, the certificate of correction shall be an officers’ certificate of the surviving corporation only. In all other instances, the certificate of correction shall be either an officer’s certificate or a certificate signed and verified as provided in this division with respect to the agreement, certificate or other instrument being corrected.

- (c) 

  - A certificate of correction shall set forth the following:

  - (1) The name or names of the corporation or corporations.

  - (2) The date the agreement, certificate or other instrument being corrected was filed.

  - (3) The provision in the agreement, certificate or other instrument as corrected and, if the execution was defective, wherein it was defective.

  - (4) If applicable, that the certificate does not alter the wording of any resolution or written consent which was in fact adopted by the board or the shareholders.

- (d) A provision of the articles, amended articles, restated articles, or certificate of determination being corrected by a certificate of correction shall be identified in the certificate of correction in accordance with subdivision (a) of Section 907.

- (e) The filing of the certificate of correction shall not alter the effective time of the agreement, certificate or instrument being corrected, which shall remain as its original effective time, and such filing shall not affect any right or liability accrued or incurred before such filing, except that any right or liability accrued or incurred by reason of the error or defect being corrected shall be extinguished by such filing if the person having that right has not detrimentally relied on the original instrument.
